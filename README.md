Landslide susceptibility mapping using Machine Learning  in Vietnam and Japan with the integration of XG boost model

Four different machine learning algorithms - Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Extreme Gradient Boosting have been trained to classify the data samples as landslide or non-landslide, treating the Machine Learning task as a binary classification. The classification has been validated through the test data and through an external data set for an area located outside of the area of interest.

While the performances varied slightly among the four  models, the results show that the applied Machine Learning models have potential in landslide susceptibility mapping in Vietnam and japan, with RF and XG being the two models iwth consistant performance when performing validation on another area with similar topography. The mapping can potentially become a step on the way to planning for areas susceptible to landslides and for mitigating the potential risks associated with them.
